## Fullstack Open Course â€” Part 3

### a) Node.js and Express

* NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime based on Google's Chrome V8 JavaScript engine.

* npm (i.e. node package manager) is a tool used for managing JavaScript packages. In fact, npm originates from the Node ecosystem.

* Use the command `npm init` to initiate a project that will automatically generate a _package.json_ file at the root of the project. The file contains information about the project.

* Within the package.json file we can modify the _scripts_ object from

  ```json
  {
    "name": "backend",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "description": "",
    "main": "index.js",
    "scripts": {
      "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    },
    "author": "Matti Luukkainen",
    "license": "MIT"
  }
  ```

  to include a "start" script:

  ```json
  {
    // ...
    "scripts": {
      "start": "node index.js",
      "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    },
    // ...
  }
  ```

* We then create an _index.js_ file to the root of the project and add the following code to that file:

  ```javascript
  console.log('hello world');
  ```

* We can run the program directly with Node from the command line:

  ```
  node index.js
  ```

* Or we can run it as an npm script:

  ```
  npm start
  ```

* The _start npm_ script works because we defined it in the _package.json_ file.

* Even though the execution of the project works when it is started by calling `node index.js` from the command line, it's customary for npm projects to execute such tasks as npm scripts.

#### Simple web server

* Let's change the application into a web server by editing the `index.js` files as follow:

  ```javascript
  const http = require('http')
  
  const app = http.createServer((request, response) => {
    response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' })
    response.end('Hello World')
  })
  
  const PORT = 3001
  app.listen(PORT)
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`)
  ```

* Let's take a closer look at the first line of the code:

  ```javascript
  const http = require('http')
  ```

  In the first row, the application imports Node's built-in web server module. This is practically what we have already been doing in our browser-side code, but with a slightly different syntax:

  ```javascript
  import http from 'http'
  ```

  These days, code that runs in the browser uses ES6 modules. Modules are defined with an export and taken into use with an import.

  However, Node.js uses so-called CommonJS modules. The reason for this is that the Node ecosystem had a need for modules long before JavaScript supported them in the language specification. Node supports now also the use of ES6 modules, but since the support is yet not quite perfect we'll stick to CommonJS modules.

  CommonJS modules function almost exactly like ES6 modules, at least as far as our needs in this course are concerned.  

* The next chunk in our code looks like this:

  ```javascript
  const app = http.createServer((request, response) => {
    response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' })
    response.end('Hello World')
  })
  ```

  The code uses the `createServer` method of the http module to create a new web server. An _event handler_ is registered to the server that is called _every time_ an HTTP request is made to the server's address http://localhost:3001.  

  The request is responded to with the status code 200, with the _Content-Type_ header set to _text/plain_, and the content of the site to be returned set to _Hello World_.  

* The last rows bind the http server assigned to the `app` variable, to listen to HTTP requests sent to the port 3001:

  ```javascript
  const PORT = 3001
  app.listen(PORT)
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`)
  ```

* The primary purpose of the backend server in this course is to offer raw data in the JSON format to the frontend. For this reason, let's immediately change our server to return a hardcoded list of notes in the JSON format:

  ```javascript
  const http = require('http')
  
  let notes = [
    {
      id: 1,
      content: "HTML is easy",
      date: "2022-05-30T17:30:31.098Z",
      important: true
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      content: "Browser can execute only Javascript",
      date: "2022-05-30T18:39:34.091Z",
      important: false
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      content: "GET and POST are the most important methods of HTTP protocol",
      date: "2022-05-30T19:20:14.298Z",
      important: true
    }
  ]
  const app = http.createServer((request, response) => {
    response.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' })
    response.end(JSON.stringify(notes))
  })
  
  const PORT = 3001
  app.listen(PORT)
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`)
  ```

  The _application/json_ value in the _Content-Type_ header informs the receiver that the data is in the JSON format. The `notes` array gets transformed into JSON with the `JSON.stringify(notes)` method.  

  When we open the browser, the displayed format is exactly the same as in part 2 where we used json-server to serve the list of notes:

  ![fullstack content](https://fullstackopen.com/static/33c3c629d8c3719de79f177cd03d7a71/5a190/2e.png)

#### Express

* Implementing our server code directly with Node's built-in http web server is possible. However, it is cumbersome, especially once the application grows in size.

* Many libraries have been developed to ease server side development with Node, by offering a more pleasing interface to work with the built-in http module. These libraries aim to provide a better abstraction for general use cases we usually require to build a backend server. By far the most popular library intended for this purpose is express. 

* Let's take express into use by defining it as a project dependency with the command:

  ```
  npm install express
  ```

* The dependency is also added to our _package.json_ file:

  ```json
  {
    // ...
    "dependencies": {
      "express": "^4.17.2"
    }
  }
  ```

  The source code for the dependency is installed to the _node_modules_ directory located in the root of the project. In addition to express, you can find a great amount of other dependencies in the directory:

  ![fullstack content](https://fullstackopen.com/static/da4cca859c66e0bf7d064455a105ad49/5a190/4.png)

* These are in fact dependencies of the express library, and the dependencies of all of its dependencies, and so forth. These are called the transitive dependencies of our project.

* What does the caret in front of the version number in _package.json_ mean?

  ```json
  "express": "^4.17.2"
  ```

  The versioning model used in npm is called semantic versioning.  

  The caret in the front of _^4.17.2_ means that if and when the dependencies of a project are updated, the version of express that is installed will be at least _4.17.2_. However, the installed version of express can also be one that has a larger _patch_ number (the last number), or a larger _minor_ number (the middle number). The major version of the library indicated by the first _major_ number must be the same.

* We can update the dependencies of the project with the command:

  ```
  npm update
  ```

* Likewise, if we start working on the project on another computer, we can install all up-to-date dependencies of the project defined in _package.json_ with running the below command in the project's root directory:

  ```
  npm install
  ```

* If the _major_ number of a dependency does not change, then the newer versions should be backwards compatible. This means that if our application happened to use version 4.99.175 of express in the future, then all the code implemented in this part would still have to work without making changes to the code. In contrast, the future 5.0.0. version of express may contain changes that would cause our application to no longer work.

#### Web and express

* Let's get back to our application and make the following changes:

  ```javascript
  const express = require('express')
  const app = express()
  
  let notes = [
    ...
  ]
  
  app.get('/', (request, response) => {
    response.send('<h1>Hello World!</h1>')
  })
  
  app.get('/api/notes', (request, response) => {
    response.json(notes)
  })
  
  const PORT = 3001
  app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`)
  })
  ```

* The application did not change a whole lot. Right at the beginning of our code we're importing `express`, which this time is a _function_ that is used to create an express application stored in the `app` variable:

  ```javascript
  const express = require('express');
  const app = express();
  ```

* Next, we define two _routes_ to the application. The first one defines an event handler that is used to handle HTTP GET requests made to the application's / root:

  ```javascript
  app.get('/', (request, response) => {
    response.send('<h1>Hello World!</h1>');
  });
  ```

* The event handler function accepts two parameters. The first request parameter contains all of the information of the HTTP request, and the second response parameter is used to define how the request is responded to.

* In our code, the request is answered by using the send method of the `response` object. Calling the method makes the server respond to the HTTP request by sending a response containing the string `<h1>Hello World!</h1>` that was passed to the `send` method. Since the parameter is a string, express automatically sets the value of the _Content-Type_ header to be _text/html_. The status code of the response defaults to 200.  

* The second route defines an event handler that handles HTTP GET requests to the _notes_ path of the application:

  ```javascript
  app.get('/api/notes', (request, response) => {
    response.json(notes);
  });
  ```

  The request is responded to with the json method of the `response` object. Calling the method will send the notes array that was passed to it as a JSON formatted string. Express automatically sets the _Content-Type_ header with the appropriate value of _application/json_.

* It's worth noting that JSON is a string, and not a JavaScript object like the value assigned to `notes`.

#### nodemon

* If we make changes to the application's code we have to restart the application in order to see the changes. We restart the application by first shutting it down by typing `Ctrl+C` and then restarting the application. Compared to the convenient workflow in React where the browser automatically reloaded after changes were made, this feels slightly cumbersome.

* The solution to this problem is nodemon:

  _nodemon will watch the files in the directory in which nodemon was started, and if any files change, nodemon will automatically restart your node application._

* Let's install nodemon by defining it as a _development dependency_ with the command:

  ```
  npm install --save-dev nodemon
  ```

* By development dependencies, we are referring to tools that are needed only during the development of the application, e.g. for testing or automatically restarting the application, like _nodemon_.

* These development dependencies are not needed when the application is run in production mode on the production server (e.g. Heroku).

* We can start our application with _nodemon_ like this:

  ```
  node_modules/.bin/nodemon index.js
  ```

* Changes to the application code now cause the server to restart automatically. It's worth noting that even though the backend server restarts automatically, the browser still has to be manually refreshed.

* The command is long and quite unpleasant, so let's define a dedicated _npm script_ for it in the _package.json_ file:

  ```javascript
  {
    // ..
    "scripts": {
      "start": "node index.js",
      "dev": "nodemon index.js",
      "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    },
    // ..
  }
  ```

  In the script there is no need to specify the _node_modules/.bin/nodemon_ path to nodemon, because `npm` automatically knows to search for the file from that directory.

* We can now start the server in the development mode with the command:

  ```
  npm run dev
  ```

  Unlike with the _start_ and _test_ scripts, we also have to add _run_ to the command.

#### REST

* Representational State Transfer, aka REST, was introduced in 2000 in Roy Fielding's dissertation. REST is an architectural style meant for building scalable web applications.  

* We are not going to dig into Fielding's definition of REST or spend time pondering about what is and isn't RESTful. Instead, we take a more [narrow view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Applied_to_web_services) by only concerning ourselves with how RESTful APIs are typically understood in web applications. The original definition of REST is in fact not even limited to web applications.

* We mentioned in the [previous part](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part2/altering_data_in_server#rest) that singular things, like notes in the case of our application, are called *resources* in RESTful thinking. Every resource has an associated URL which is the resource's unique address.

* One convention is to create the unique address for resources by combining the name of the resource type with the resource's unique identifier.

* Let's assume that the root URL of our service is *www.example.com/api*.

* If we define the resource type of note to be *notes*, then the address of a note resource with the identifier 10, has the unique address *www.example.com/api/notes/10*.

* The URL for the entire collection of all note resources is *www.example.com/api/notes*.

* We can execute different operations on resources. The operation to be executed is defined by the HTTP *verb*:

  | URL      | verb   | functionality                                                |
  | :------- | :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
  | notes/10 | GET    | fetches a single resource                                    |
  | notes    | GET    | fetches all resources in the collection                      |
  | notes    | POST   | creates a new resource based on the request data             |
  | notes/10 | DELETE | removes the identified resource                              |
  | notes/10 | PUT    | replaces the entire identified resource with the request data |
  | notes/10 | PATCH  | replaces a part of the identified resource with the request data |

* This is how we manage to roughly define what REST refers to as a [uniform interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Architectural_constraints), which means a consistent way of defining interfaces that makes it possible for systems to co-operate.
* This way of interpreting REST falls under the [second level of RESTful maturity](https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html) in the Richardson Maturity Model. According to the definition provided by Roy Fielding, we have not actually defined a [REST API](http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven). In fact, a large majority of the world's purported "REST" APIs do not meet Fielding's original criteria outlined in his dissertation.
* In some places (see e.g. [Richardson, Ruby: RESTful Web Services](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529260.do)) you will see our model for a straightforward [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) API, being referred to as an example of [resource oriented architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource-oriented_architecture) instead of REST. We will avoid getting stuck arguing semantics and instead return to working on our application.

#### Fetching a single resource

* Let's expand our application so that it offers a REST interface for operating on individual notes. First let's create a [route](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) for fetching a single resource.

* The unique address we will use for an individual note is of the form *notes/10*, where the number at the end refers to the note's unique id number.

* We can define [parameters](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html#route-parameters) for routes in express by using the colon syntax:

  ```javascript
  app.get('/api/notes/:id', (request, response) => {
    const id = request.params.id
    const note = notes.find(note => note.id === id)
    response.json(note)
  })
  ```

  Now `app.get('/api/notes/:id', ...)`will handle all HTTP GET requests that are of the form */api/notes/SOMETHING*, where *SOMETHING* is an arbitrary string.

* The *id* parameter in the route of a request, can be accessed through the [request](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req) object:

  ```javascript
  const id = request.params.id;
  ```

* The now familiar *find* method of arrays is used to find the note with an id that matches the parameter. The note is then returned to the sender of the request.

* When we test our application by going to http://localhost:3001/api/notes/1 in our browser, we notice that it does not appear to work, as the browser displays an empty page.

* After using `console.log` to debug the problem, the cause of the bug becomes clear. The *id* variable contains a string '1', whereas the ids of notes are integers. In JavaScript, the "triple equals" comparison === considers all values of different types to not be equal by default, meaning that 1 is not '1'.

* Let's fix the issue by changing the id parameter from a string into a number:

  ```javascript
  app.get('/api/notes/:id', (request, response) => {
    const id = Number(request.params.id)
    const note = notes.find(note => note.id === id)
    response.json(note)
  })
  ```

* Now fetching an individual resource works.

  ![fullstack content](https://fullstackopen.com/static/f44de7adb5426baa10d552837073aa5c/5a190/9ea.png)

* However, there's another problem with our application.

* If we search for a note with an id that does not exist, the server responds with:

  ![fullstack content](https://fullstackopen.com/static/71dba69685a59c3d5249303257863366/5a190/10ea.png)

* The HTTP status code that is returned is 200, which means that the response succeeded. There is no data sent back with the response, since the value of the *content-length* header is 0, and the same can be verified from the browser.

* The reason for this behavior is that the *note* variable is set to *undefined* if no matching note is found. The situation needs to be handled on the server in a better way. If no note is found, the server should respond with the status code [404 not found](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-404-not-found) instead of 200.

* Let's make the following change to our code:

  ```java
  app.get('/api/notes/:id', (request, response) => {
    const id = Number(request.params.id)
    const note = notes.find(note => note.id === id)
    
    if (note) {
      response.json(note)
    } else {
      response.status(404).end()
    }
  })

* Since no data is attached to the response, we use the [status](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.status) method for setting the status, and the [end](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.end) method for responding to the request without sending any data.

#### Deleting resources

* Next let's implement a route for deleting resources. Deletion happens by making an HTTP DELETE request to the url of the resource:

  ```javascript
  app.delete('/api/notes/:id', (request, response) => {
    const id = Number(request.params.id)
    notes = notes.filter(note => note.id !== id)
  
    response.status(204).end()
  })
  ```

* If deleting the resource is successful, meaning that the note exists and it is removed, we respond to the request with the status code [204 no content](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-204-no-content) and return no data with the response.
* There's no consensus on what status code should be returned to a DELETE request if the resource does not exist. Really, the only two options are 204 and 404. For the sake of simplicity our application will respond with 204 in both cases.

#### Postman

* So how do we test the delete operation? HTTP GET requests are easy to make from the browser. We could write some JavaScript for testing deletion, but writing test code is not always the best solution in every situation.
* Many tools exist for making the testing of backends easier. One of these is a command line program [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/). However, instead of curl, we will take a look at using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for testing the application.

#### Receiving data

* Next, let's make it possible to add new notes to the server. Adding a note happens by making an HTTP POST request to the address http://localhost:3001/api/notes, and by sending all the information for the new note in the request [body](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec7.html#sec7) in the JSON format.

* In order to access the data easily, we need the help of the express [json-parser](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html) that is taken to use with command *app.use(express.json())*.

* Let's activate the json-parser and implement an initial handler for dealing with the HTTP POST requests:

  ```javascript
  const express = require('express')
  const app = express()
  
  app.use(express.json())
  
  //...
  
  app.post('/api/notes', (request, response) => {
    const note = request.body
    console.log(note)
    response.json(note)
  })
  ```

* The event handler function can access the data from the _body_ property of the `request` object.

* Without the json-parser, the _body_ property would be undefined. The json-parser functions so that it takes the JSON data of a request, transforms it into a JavaScript object and then attaches it to the _body_ property of the `request` object before the route handler is called.  

* For the time being, the application does not do anything with the received data besides printing it to the console and sending it back in the response.

* Before we implement the rest of the application logic, let's verify with Postman that the data is actually received by the server. In addition to defining the URL and request type in Postman, we also have to define the data sent in the *body*:

  ![fullstack content](https://fullstackopen.com/static/c34207e9d243ac3b534678fc397f61ea/5a190/14x.png)

*  Once we know that the application receives data correctly, it's time to finalize the handling of the request:

  ```javascript
  app.post('/api/notes', (request, response) => {
    const maxId = notes.length > 0
      ? Math.max(...notes.map(n => n.id)) 
      : 0
  
    const note = request.body
    note.id = maxId + 1
  
    notes = notes.concat(note)
  
    response.json(note)
  })
  ```

* We need a unique id for the note. First, we find out the largest id number in the current list and assign it to the `maxId` variable. The id of the new note is then defined as `maxId + 1`. This method is in fact not recommended, but we will live with it for now as we will replace it soon enough.

* The current version still has the problem that the HTTP POST request can be used to add objects with arbitrary properties. Let's improve the application by defining that the *content* property may not be empty. The *important* and *date* properties will be given default values. All other properties are discarded:

  ```javascript
  const generateId = () => {
    const maxId = notes.length > 0
      ? Math.max(...notes.map(n => n.id))
      : 0
    return maxId + 1
  }
  
  app.post('/api/notes', (request, response) => {
    const body = request.body
  
    if (!body.content) {
      return response.status(400).json({ 
        error: 'content missing' 
      })
    }
  
    const note = {
      content: body.content,
      important: body.important || false,
      date: new Date(),
      id: generateId(),
    }
  
    notes = notes.concat(note)
  
    response.json(note)
  })
  ```

* The logic for generating the new id number for notes has been extracted into a separate *generateId* function.

* If the received data is missing a value for the *content* property, the server will respond to the request with the status code [400 bad request](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-400-bad-request):

  ```javascript
  if (!body.content) {
    return response.status(400).json({ 
      error: 'content missing' 
    })
  }
  ```

* Notice that calling return is crucial, because otherwise the code will execute to the very end and the malformed note gets saved to the application.

* If the content property has a value, the note will be based on the received data. As mentioned previously, it is better to generate timestamps on the server than in the browser, since we can't trust that host machine running the browser has its clock set correctly. The generation of the *date* property is now done by the server.

* If the *important* property is missing, we will default the value to *false*. The default value is currently generated in a rather odd-looking way:

  ```javascript
  important: body.important || false,
  ```
