### b) Custom hooks

#### Hooks

* Let's recap the rules of using hooks, copied verbatim from the official React documentation:

  **Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.** Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your React function.

  **Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions.** Instead, you can:

  - Call Hooks from React function components.
  - Call Hooks from custom Hooks

#### Custom hooks

* React offers the option to create our own [custom](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html) hooks. According to React, the primary purpose of custom hooks is to facilitate the reuse of the logic used in components.

  _Building your own Hooks lets you extract component logic into reusable functions._

* Custom hooks are regular JavaScript functions that can use any other hooks, as long as they adhere to the [rules of hooks](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part1/a_more_complex_state_debugging_react_apps#rules-of-hooks). Additionally, the name of custom hooks must start with the word *use*.
