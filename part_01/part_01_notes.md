## Fullstack Open Course â€” Part 1

### a) Introduction to React

#### Component

Example of a component

```javascript
const App = () => {
  return (
  	<div>
    	<p>Hello world</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

* React component names must be capitalized.

* The content of a React component (usually) needs to contain one root element. If we, for example, try to define the component _App_ without the outermost _div_-element:

  ```javascript
  const App = () => {
    return (
    	<h1>Greetings</h1>
      <Hello name='Maya' age={26 + 10} />
  		<Footer />
    )
  }
  ```

  the result is an error message.

* Because the root element is stipulated, we have "extra" div-elements in the DOM-tree. This can be avoided by using fragments, i.e. by wrapping the elements to be returned by the component with an empty element:

  ```javascript
  const App = () => {
    const name = 'Peter';
    const age = 10;
    
    return (
      <>
      	<h1>Greetings</h1>
      	<Hello name='Maya' age={26 + 10} />
  			<Hello name={name} age={age} />
        <Footer />
      </>
    )
  }
  ```

  It now compiles successfully, and the DOM generated by React no longer contains the extra div-element.

#### JSX

* JSX looks like HTML, but it is actually a way to write JavaScript.
* Under the hood, JSX returned by React components is compiled into JavaScript.
* In practice, JSX is much like HTML with the distinction that with JSX you can easily embed dynamic content by writing appropriate JavaScript within curly braces.
* JSX is "XML-like", which means that every tag needs to be closed.

#### props: passing data to components

* It is possible to pass data to components using so-called props.
* There can be an arbitrary number of props.

Example:

```javascript
const Hello = (props) => {
  return (
  	<div>
    	<p>Hello {props.name}</p>
		</div>
  )
}
```

The function defining a component above has a parameter _props_. As an argument, the parameter receives an object, which has fields corresponding to all the "props" the user of the component defines.  

The props are defined as follows:

```javascript
const App = () => {
  return (
  	<div>
    	<h1>Greetings</h1>
    	<Hello name='George' />
    	<Hello name='Daisy' />
    </div>
  )
}
```
