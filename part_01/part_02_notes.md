## Fullstack Open Course — Part 2

### a) Rendering a collection, modules

#### Rendering Collections

Let's start with the following example (the file _App.js_):

```javascript
const App = (props) => {
  const { notes } = props

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Notes</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>{notes[0].content}</li>
        <li>{notes[1].content}</li>
        <li>{notes[2].content}</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

The file _index.js_ looks like:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'

import App from './App'

const notes = [
  {
    id: 1,
    content: 'HTML is easy',
    date: '2019-05-30T17:30:31.098Z',
    important: true
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    content: 'Browser can execute only JavaScript',
    date: '2019-05-30T18:39:34.091Z',
    important: false
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    content: 'GET and POST are the most important methods of HTTP protocol',
    date: '2019-05-30T19:20:14.298Z',
    important: true
  }
]

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <App notes={notes} />
)
```

The example above works due to the fact that there are exactly three notes in the array.  

A single note is rendered by accessing the objects in the array by referring to a hard-coded index number:

```javascript
<li>{notes[1].content}</li>
```

This is, of course, not practical. We can improve on this by generating React elements from the array objects using the map function.  

```javascript
notes.map(note => <li>{note.content}</li>);
```

The result is an array of _li_ elements.

```javascript
[
  <li>HTML is easy</li>,
  <li>Browser can execute only JavaScript</li>,
  <li>GET and POST are the most important methods of HTTP protocol</li>,
]
```

Which can then be placed inside _ul_ tags:

```javascript
const App = (props) => {
  const { notes } = props

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Notes</h1>
      <ul>
        {notes.map(note => 
          <li>
            {note.content}
          </li>
        )}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### Key-attribute

Even though the application seems to be working, there is a nasty warning in the console:

```
Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.

Check the render method of `App`. See https://reactjs.org/link/warning-keys for more information.
    at li
    at App (http://localhost:3000/static/js/bundle.js:23:5)
```

As the error message suggests; the list items, i.e. the elements generated by the `map` method, must each have a unique key value: an attribute called _key_.  

Let's add the keys:

```javascript
const App = (props) => {
  const { notes } = props

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Notes</h1>
      <ul>
        {notes.map(note => 
          <li key={note.id}>
            {note.content}
          </li>
        )}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

And the error message disappears.  

React uses the key attributes of objects in an array to determine how to update the view generated by a component when the component is re-rendered.

#### Refactoring Modules

We'll separate displaying a single note into its own component _Note_:

```javascript
const Note = ({ note }) => {
  return (
    <li>{note.content}</li>
  )
}

const App = ({ notes }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Notes</h1>
      <ul>
        {notes.map(note => 
          <Note key={note.id} note={note} />
        )}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Note that the _key_ attribute must now be defined for the _Note_ components, and not for the _li_ tags like before.  

A whole React application can be written in a single file. Although that is, of course, not very practical. Common practice is to declare each component in their own file as an _ES6-module_.  

We have been using modules the whole time. The first few lines of the file _index.js_:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'

import App from './App'
```

import three modules, enabling them to be used in that file. The module _React_ is placed into the variable `React`, the module _react-dom_ into the variable `ReactDOM`, and the module that defines the main component of the app is placed into the variable `App`

Let's move our _Note_ component into its own module.  

In smaller applications, components are usually placed in a directory called _components_, which is in turn placed within the _src_ directory. The convention is to name the file after the component.  

Now, we'll create a directory called _components_ for our application and place a file named _Note.js_ inside. The contents of the Note.js file are as follows:

```javascript
const Note = ({ note }) => {
  return (
    <li>{note.content}</li>
  )
}

export default Note
```

The last line of the module exports the declared module, the variable _Note_.  

Now the file that is using the component—_App.js_—can import the module:  

```javascript
import Note from './components/Note'

const App = ({ notes }) => {
  // ...
}
```

The component exported by the module is now available for use in the variable _Note_, just as it was earlier.  

Note that when importing our own components, their location must be given _in relation to the importing file_:

```
'./components/Note'
```

The period—.—in the beginning refers to the current directory, so the module's location is a file called _Note.js_ in the _components_ sub-directory of the current directory. The filename extension `.js` can be omitted.
